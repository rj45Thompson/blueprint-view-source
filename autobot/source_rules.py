"""source_rules.py - every RULE the reference source states must be cited by a REQUIREMENT, in the source's own subject.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-10-24, Rampart): a key game mechanic was missing from the requirements, and the use-case gap check did
not catch it. A ring of wall with no piece missing encloses a castle, and a player with no enclosed castle when time runs out
loses the round. This file is the repair: a rule sentence of the source that no requirement cites is now a reported hole.

What failed was not the walk, it was what the walk was given. interrogate.py proved every row of the closed space
(research/super_rampart_space.json) mapped to a use case, and it did: row S15 "repair is timed; no enclosed castle at the end
loses the round" mapped to UC-10. But S15 was MY PARAPHRASE of the manual's ":675-677 if YOU do not have at least one Castle
completely enclosed when time runs out, YOU lose the round" - the paraphrase dropped the subject, the requirement written from
it said "the TEAM loses one life", and from then on every gate agreed with every other gate about a rule the source never
states. Same for S17 "cannon award: home castle 2, every other castle 1" against ":691-692 based on the number of Castles YOU
surround". A space row is a summary; a gate that checks only summaries certifies the summariser.

So this check reads the SOURCE, not the summary:
  1. RuleSentence - every sentence of the source that states a rule (a modal or rule verb: must, cannot, only, lose, win,
     become, award, will ...), with its line numbers. Mechanical: nobody gets to decide which sentences matter.
  2. Requirement  - every line of the requirements file, with the source lines it cites (":675-677", ":752-758, :1089-1094").
  3. A sentence is COVERED when a live (not SUPERSEDED) requirement cites a range overlapping it. A WIDE cite (more than
     BLOCK lines) covers a sentence only if the requirement also shares content words with it - a cite of :654-698 is a
     pointer at a page, not a statement of each rule on it.
  4. A sentence is EXCLUDED only by a recorded reason (the space's "source_excluded" list, or a space row whose copy cell
     is 'no' - two-player-only rules in a co-op game, secret codes the product owner ruled out).
  5. SUBJECT DRIFT: a sentence whose subject is the PLAYER ("you", "your", "he", "his") cited only by requirements that
     speak of the TEAM ("team", "shared") and never of a player. This is the exact paraphrase that lost Rampart its death rule.

An uncovered sentence and a drift are QUESTIONS (interrogate.py --source prints them and fails). Measured on the plant: the
requirements file as it stood before the 10-24 fix leaves :675-677 and :689-698 uncovered.
