"""usecase_model.py - a use case model kept as DATA, and the gap checker that reads it.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-10-27): the markdown gap checker was suspected of missing holes, perhaps hundreds. Use case descriptions
also needed a hierarchy (child use cases under their parent's steps), and every pathway of a use case description, not only the
main scenario, has to be accounted for, because between them the pathways should carry every possible requirement.

MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS WRITTEN (.opus-tools/quarantine/blueprint_view/GAPCHECK_BASELINE.md): a model the markdown checker
passed (interrogate.py 25 questions, coverage.py 20/20, source_rules.py 0 holes) had 2 of 20 requirements that no step
carried, 14 of 14 extension pathways that named no requirement, 10 of 14 with no stated outcome, and 22 of 44 source
sentences never checked, because the rule-word filter does not fire on an essay. The markdown checker reads table rows;
extensions, the hierarchy and who-carries-which-requirement are prose to it. Here they are fields, so each one is counted.

THE MODEL: a folder of YAML files. Any file may hold any of these top-level keys; lists are concatenated across files.
  meta:          {subject, mode, story: {text, clauses: [{text, source}]}}
  actors:        [{id, name, kind: person | ai | system, profile}]
  sources:       [{id, kind: prose | quote | standing | framework, path (prose), text, cite}]
  spaces:        [{id, title, basis: prose | framework | language | brainstorm | code, kind: sentences | grid | extract | list,
                   source (sentences), dims + surfaces (grid), file + pattern (extract),
                   cells: {key: [req ids] | {maps: [req ids], text} | {excluded: reason}}}]
  requirements:  [{id, kind: authored | derived | inferred, text, measure, sources: [source ids], why (inferred),
                   effect: [{sets | calls | branches | reads: <name>, to, args, by (sets: through a call),
                             at: <graph>[#sN[:<outcome>]]}] | {absent: why}}]
  terms:         [{term, binds: [code names], why}]   a word of the requirements bound to what it means in the code
  meta.loop:     {closed: true, entry: [{name, why}]}  held to the closed-loop criteria (usecase_kg.py loop); entry names are
                   conditions set outside the model (an engine call, another Blueprint), each with the reason
  usecases:      [{id, name, level: kite | sea | fish, parent: {uc, step | ext}, actor, supporting, trigger, pre, minimal,
                   success, why, where, gulf: {exec: {text, reqs}, eval: {text, reqs}} (kite and sea),
                   steps: [{do, reqs, includes}], ext: [{at, when, do: [...], includes, out: "rejoin N" | "end success" |
                   "end minimal", reqs}]}]
  questions:     [{id, persona, text, inverse}]   the brainstorm: each question is answered by (inverted into) a use case

THE RULES. Every one is a code, and --selftest plants one fault per code and requires that code to fire:
  U1  FIELDS     a use case lacks a field, has a bad level, or a main scenario outside 3-11 steps (2-11 for fish)
  U2  PARENT     a sea or fish use case has no parent, the parent or its step is missing, a child ranks above its parent,
                 or the parents form a cycle
  U3  KITE       a kite step decomposes into nothing: no child use case and no include
  U4  EXTENSION  an alternate pathway lacks its step, its condition, its handling, a valid outcome or a requirement
  U5  CARRIER    a requirement that no step and no extension carries - a requirement no pathway realises
  U6  SOURCE     a requirement with no source: authored without an authored source, derived without a space cell,
                 inferred without a reason
  U7  CELL       a closed space's cell is missing, unmapped, mapped to an unknown requirement, or excluded with no reason
  U8  REF        an id that resolves to nothing (requirement, include, actor, persona, source)
  U9  ACTOR      a person who is primary actor of no use case
  U10 MEASURE    a requirement with no way to check it
  U11 QUESTION   a brainstormed question that inverts into no use case
  U12 STEP       a step that carries no requirement and includes nothing that does
  U13 GULF       a kite or sea use case that does not say how the person acts (execution) and how they see the result
                 (evaluation), each with requirements carried in its own subtree (Norman's two gulfs)
  U14 STORY      a problem story clause with no source
  U15 DUP        two things with one id
  U16 KITE-ONLY  a requirement carried only by kite (summary) steps, realised by no user goal or subfunction
  U17 NO-ALT     a use case of 3+ steps with no alternate pathway: what happens when a step cannot complete was never written
  U18 EFFECT     in a closed-loop model, a requirement with no effect and no reason it has none, or an assertion with no
                 single verb, no place, or a `to`/`args` its verb does not take
  U19 TERM       a term that binds no code name, or an entry condition with no reason
INFERRED requirements are not holes: they are the questions only the owner can answer, and are listed as such.
