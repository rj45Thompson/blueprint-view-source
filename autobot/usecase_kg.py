"""usecase_kg.py - a use case model as a KNOWLEDGE GRAPH: one SQLite store, a store-declared completeness schema, and the gap
queries a graph can answer that the rules over YAML cannot.

WHY (2026-10-27): the knowledge graph the project already keeps can detect gaps that the rules over YAML cannot, provided the
graph is stable, efficient and in a sound format: a production-quality node graph store, not a JSON file.

JOINED, NOT A FIFTH STORE. ANCHOR_API.md (the anchor project) records a use-case graph that was deleted the day it was written for
being "a fourth store with its own rules". This one is joined to what exists:
  - built from the SAME loader as the rules checker (autobot/usecase_model.py's UseCaseModel), so there is one parse;
  - the Anchor store's relation numbers are reused where the meaning matches (100 has step, 101 next step, 102 performed
    by, 107 binds requirement, 108 infers requirement, 109 goal, 110 trigger, 114 stated by); new relations start at 116;
  - the completeness schema is DECLARED BY THE STORE (ANCHOR API invariant I7) in its schema_rule table, and the gap query is a
    generic walk over it - adding a rule is adding a row, not code;
  - entity ids come from identity (kind + the model's own id), never from a counter (invariant I12), so a rebuild is stable;
  - SQLite, chosen by measurement (quarantine/blueprint_view/KG_SURVEY.md, K3): the fastest of the four installed systems on every
    query shape, and Node 25's built-in node:sqlite reads the same file, so the Anchor 2 engine can join it.
  - its review format is N-Triples (one W3C triple per line, sorted): two builds of one model are byte-identical.

THE ANCHOR COUNT. Every edge carries the evidence FAMILY that asserts it (1 story = the product owner's words, 2 framework = a
published ergonomics framework, 4 language = the C# language, 8 brainstorm = a persona's question, 16 model = this model's own
structure, 32 code = exists in the code). A requirement's k is the number of DISTINCT families other than the model's own
structure behind it - the anchor law: the author's own structure never raises k (ANCHOR API I2). k = 0 for a requirement that is
not inferred is a hole; k = 1 is listed: it rests on one family, and the question is which independent family would confirm it.

THE CLOSED LOOP (2026-10-28). Closed-loop requirements replace code as what an AI acts on: it writes the code from them and is
held to them, so they must leave no room for a mistake that is not already in the requirements themselves. LOOP lists the
criteria a node structure must meet for that to hold, each one named by the mistake it stops; LoopGate measures them all. A
requirement's EFFECT (usecase_model.Assertion: what the code sets, calls, branches on or reads, and where) is the keystone: the
code adapter (quarantine/blueprint_view/tools/logic_map.py) holds each assertion to the code and plants it the other way, and
its verdicts.json comes in here. The lock (<model>/loop.lock) is each requirement's fingerprint as last verified.
